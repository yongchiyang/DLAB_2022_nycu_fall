2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net M_Next_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin M_Next_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell M_Next_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net N_next_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin N_next_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell N_next_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net P_Next is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin FSM_onehot_P_Next_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell FSM_onehot_P_Next_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
